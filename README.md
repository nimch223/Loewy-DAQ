## Background  
Using two ADXL345 accelerometers connected to an Adafruit METRO (a microcontroller that
is equivalent to the Arduino Uno), vibrational analysis of a four high rolling mill can be
performed. The two accelerometers in their housings are to be mounted on the upper backup
roll and top housing of the rolling mill in Whitaker 165.
  
 These two locations for the placement of
the accelerometers were chosen based on a literature review in which it was discovered that
the upper backup roll and top housing demonstrate a higher sensitivity to chatter, making them
ideal locations for the permanent installation of acceleration sensors [Niroomand et al. 864].
  
The accelerometers measure the vertical vibration of the mill for the presence of chatter, the
intense and undesirable vibration of the mill that can negatively impact the rollers and affect
the quality of the rolled material. The most destructive forms of chatter occur at the third and
fifth octave modes of vibration, 100 - 200 Hz and 500 - 700 Hz respectively [Choudhary et al.
1].   

At third octave chatter conditions, the rolled sample experiences poor surface finish quality
and variations in thickness, while at fifth octave chatter conditions the sample experiences
even worse surface finish, larger variations in thickness and potential rupture of the sample,
and the backup and work rolls can experience transverse bending. 

The goal in installing these
vibrational sensors on the rolling mill in Whitaker 165 is to better understand the relationship
between the vibration of a one-stand mill and the quality of rolled samples, and if chatter
occurs, catch it with live vibrational monitoring before it becomes destructive to the sample and
rolls. The following document goes through the process of procuring, manufacturing, and
setting up the hardware for the vibrational sensors, and walks through the steps of how to
configure and run the software for plotting the vibrational data from the two accelerometers.

<img src="./img/fig2.JPG">   
 
- (x2) 3D-Printed Housing for ADXL345  
  - These housings were designed in SolidWorks to perfectly fit the ADXL345, as no
CAD files could be found online for the current ADXL345 accelerometer model.
Two housings were then printed out of PLA in Wilbur Powerhouse using the FDM
printers.

    - STL File (in this Github repo) for 3D printing: **ADXL345_housing.STL**
    - SolidWorks File (also in this Github repo)--if needed to edit: **ADXL345_housing.SLDPRT**

**3. Printed Circuit Board (PCB):**  
- The PCB was designed in Autodesk EAGLE, a free and intuitive PCB design software.
The physical board was then manufactured in the Electronics Design Lab in Wilbur
Powerhouse using the Othermill V2 CNC Mill. Using the soldering iron in Wilbur, four
10kÎ© resistors and break-away male headers were soldered onto the board, shown in
**Figure 6**.

- (x2) female-to-female (F/F) cables.
  - Each cable is roughly 5.5 feet and has 6 female header contacts on each side. Each cable is used to connect the 6 pins on the ADXL345 accelerometer (highlighted in **Figure 2**) to the respective header
on the PCB (labeled "ADXL345_1" and "ADXL345_2" on the schematic in **Figure 5**).
These were spliced and made in the electronics lab in Wilbur Powerhouse.

## V. Additional Information & Future Recommendations  

- The current Simulink code here on Githbu (**Two_ADXL345_accell.slx**) is relatively simple. As displayed in **Figure 11**, it is composed of two accelerometer data source blocks. These blocks are connected to a scope block, which allows for real time data visualization and the real time plotting of the vibrational data.
- These data source blocks are configured so that each block matches the respective I2C address of each accelerometer: **0x1D** and **0x53**.
  - The two accelerometers hooked up in the circuit are recognized under different addresses because one accelerometer's **SDO** pin is connected to **GND**, while the other accelerometer's **SDO** pin is not. This can be seen in **Figure 5** (the PCB schematic).
  - Double-click each accelerometer data source block to display these addresses
  - Double-clicking these blocks also displays additional parameters for the accelerometers that can be set. These parameters include important factors such as the range of acceleration that the accelerometers can measure, and the accelerometer output data rate. *These parameters should be adjusted based on further research and needs*.
  - For example, the accelerometer output data rate is automatically set at 12.5 Hz, which is not high enough for fast and accurate data streaming. The data rate can be adjusted to as high as 1600 Hz.
- This information regarding how the wiring of the pins should be configured in order to communicate with two accelerometers under two different I2C addresses was found in the ADXL345 data sheet. This data sheet, along with the Adafruit ADXL345 website that has pinout, wiring guides, example code, and more, are extremely informative and useful for understanding the capabilities and limitations of the accelerometers. The links are below:
  - ADXL345 Data Sheet: https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/adxl345.pdf
 
  - ADXL345 webpage listing: https://learn.adafruit.com/adxl345-digital-accelerometer/overview  

- The need for additional processing, filtering, or denoising of the data may be discovered in the future. The MATLAB and Simulink software was chosen due to it being relatively simple, visual, and intuitive, and an easy base to build off of.
- In order to perform this additional data processing in Simulink, extra blocks would be added to the current Simulink model.
  - Based on the processing needs, pre-built data filtering blocks can be selected from Simulink's library.
  - These filtering blocks can be easily inserted between the accelerometer data source blocks and scope blocks--some examples of filter blocks that can be added are:
    - High pass filter block
    - Automatic gain control block
    - Low pass filter block
  - From the literature review, the aforementioned filters are recommended for data processing [Niroomand et al. 857]. **Figure 17** below shows a potential block diagram for data signal filtering and processing:
 
<img src="./img/fig17.JPG">  
 
  - The process for the ADXL345 accelerometer would be similar to the process shown in **Figure 17** bit slightly different, as the accelerometers have a built in ADC, or "Analog to Digital (A/D) Converter".
